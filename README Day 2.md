# <i><b> My SQL<br> DAY 2 NOTES </b></i>
---
#### Normal Forms

- This is a standard in SQL to avoid redundancy in our data on  a database. There are multiple tiers/levels to the Normal Form standard.
---
#### 1st Normal Form

- Each field /cell has a single value ONLY
-

#### 2nd Normal Form

- It must be 1NF compliant

#### 3rd Normal Form

- It must be 2NF compliant

---
#### Null values
- These are not technically a value this is a way of the program telling us that there is no data to show in a field/cell.

###### Examples:
- Null in a string is a value
- a value of 0 is not null
- values can't equal null as it is an undefined value
